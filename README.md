# Yana Documentation

Welcome to the Yana documentation!

The documentation site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) using the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installation

You can install and build docs on Mac and Windows environments. The doc site is built on Docusaurus, which requires NodeJS and Yarn installed for your OS.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
3. Install Docusaurus to a temp location: yarn global add docusaurus-init. You can delete the temp project.

### Running the development server

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.

With npm:
```bash
npm run start
```

With Yarn:
```bash
yarn run start
```
